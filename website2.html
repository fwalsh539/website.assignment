        <h1>What came out of the riot?</h1>
            <p> The aftermath of Attica was the most surprising part, with over 45 deaths the riot was a bloody war. The prisoners received 12 million dollars distributed among the rioters. Which was not enough money to justify 2000 prisoners who were abused and treated terribly. The riot was huge for the development of starting to treat people correctly in prison. The prisoners were able to advocate for themselves and hope to see less discrimination and poor living conditions for the future of prisons. </p>

            <h1>Benefits of the riot?</h1>
            <p> Although the riot was very bad and should not have happened there were some things that came out of it which made it not a total waste. The first benefit was more family visits for the prisoners. They also made improvements to the showers. They got access to better medical care. Another thing was they started to allow education for prisoners. Religion was not free so it became allowed. Finally they gave inmates access to more options with lawyers. </p>
