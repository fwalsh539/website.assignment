        <h1>Who lead the Riot?</h1>
            <p> The man who organized the riot was L.D. Barkley. He was considered a influential leader for the riot who got the people going. He was arrested for driving without his license and believed this was unfair and did not fit the crime. He kept claiming how he wanted to help the community and needed to leave the prison so he arranged the riot. His plan was for good to come out pg the riot. Good did come out of it however as there were positive changes that were made to the prison.
