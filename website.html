    <h1>Why did the inmates Riot?</h1>
        <p> The main reason the inmates rioted was the very poor conditions. Inmates inside the prison talked about how dirty and disgusting that it was. When they entered the prison inmates entered the prison in shackles and leg irons. Inmates when they got their when right into isolation for 2 days. This was meant to set a bad president from the moment that the inmates arrived at the prison. They were also put into gray prison uniforms which they could not take off.

    <h1>Inside the prison</h1>
        <p> The cells were very small. They were only the size of a closet. That comes out to being 6 feet by 9 feet. Which is way to small for people to be living in. Also the cells did not have a window so there was no natural light. The closest window was across the hall. They have a bed, a stool, a table and a toilet. Which is not much at all when you think about how they are there all the time. The toilet was open and how no cover so it smelt very bad all the time. </p>
